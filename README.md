 <h2>Project Intro/Objective</h2>
<p><a href= https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/handle/1974/28239/David_Nam_K_202010_MSC.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y>Over the past several decades, advances in technology have significantly impacted all aspects of the financial system. While it has led to numerous benefits, it has also increased the methods for manipulating the market. A frequent platform used to perform these market manipulation schemes has been through social media. </a> Twitter is one such platform where people and potential "pumpers" also tweet about certain stocks to increase their price above a certain value. This is manipulative behavior and is known as a "pump and dump" scheme. The objective of this project to classify the stock pumps and which factors contribute to them. The null hypothesis I am making is that the tweet sentiments 'may' contribute towards it significantly.
