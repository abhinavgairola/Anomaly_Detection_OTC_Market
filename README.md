 <h2>Project Intro/Objective</h2>
<p><a href= https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/handle/1974/28239/David_Nam_K_202010_MSC.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y>Over the past several decades, advances in technology have significantly impacted
all aspects of the financial system. While it has led to numerous benefits, it has
also increased the methods for manipulating the market. A frequent platform used
to perform these market manipulation schemes has been through social media.</a> Twitter is one such platform where  people and potential "pumpers" also tweet
about certain stocks to increase its price above a certain value. <b>This is a manipulative behavior and is known as a "pump and dump" scheme</b>. The objective of this project to classify the stock pumps and which factors contribute towards. The null hypothesis I am making is that the tweet sentiments 'may' contribute towards it significantly.</p>
